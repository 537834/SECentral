# SECentral
This is the HTML code for SECentral Website. Here you will find (mostly) up-to-date code for all of the pages. 

Please note that since this website it hosted with weebly.com, it has top menu bars, which I could not control (well, I could, but dont feel like going through all of their code to find it and delete it), so therefore the code included in this GitHub page doesnt include the top bar HTML.
